# Death-star-visual
The goal for this project was to create a box that displays a piece of art inside it when an ultrasonic sensor senses movement. The plan was to use an ultrasonic sensor that needs a certain amount of movement, so that when the structure is outside it starts working. The actual art itself is a retractable door that opens using a servomotor, and inside there are red LED lights flashing behind a rotating Death Star (from Star Wars) (using a DC motor), with the Sith theme music playing from a speaker. The sensor is attached to a raspberry pi, and that is connected to an Arduino through the internet, which powers the LEDs and the 3 motors in the system. Therefore, the sensor is an ultrasonic sensor and the actuators will be the motors spinning the object and the doors, as well as the LED lights flashing. The whole system is powered by batteries, and the circuit boards are hidden below and above the main box frame where the objects are.
